<h2>Hello. Welcome.</h2>

I'm a senior post-doctoral scientist based in the [Institute of Hygiene and Applied Immunology](https://pii.meduniwien.ac.at/en/our-departments/institute-for-hygiene-and-applied-immunology/) at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. My research uses virus sequence data to characterise how viruses evolve and spread through populations. I have particular interest in engaging science communication for actionable public health response, data visualisation and reproducible research. 

I currently teach graduate courses in Data Visualisation (with R) and Science Communication.

Away from work you might find me gaming 	&#x1f3ae;, doodling &#x1f3a8;, exploring 	&#x1f6b2; or baking &#x1f9c1;.
